# JOUR405: Statistics for Journalists
## Midterm Exam - Spring 2025

Name: Laura Charleston

For this exam, you'll analyze several datasets using R and the statistical concepts we've covered in class. Load the tidyverse before beginning, then complete each task. Write your code in the provided blocks and answer the questions in complete sentences. Start by loading the tidyverse and any other libraries you think you might need.

```{r}

library(tidyverse)

```


## Part 1: Restaurant Health Inspections (15 points)

You want to understand how restaurants in Montgomery County are performing on health inspections. The first dataset contains restaurant health inspection scores for restaurants in Montgomery County. The dataset includes the name of the establishment, the number of points for critical and non-critical areas, the total points, maximum points possible and the compliance score and grade. Load the data from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/montco_inspections.csv` and complete these tasks:

```{r}
montco_inspections <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/montco_inspections.csv")
```


### Tasks:
1. Calculate the mean and standard deviation of compliance scores (5 points)

```{r}

montco_inspections |>
  summarize( mean = mean(compliance_score), sd = sd(compliance_score))

```

2. Create a histogram of the compliance scores with a vertical line showing the mean (5 points)

```{r}

montco_inspections|>
  ggplot() +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = compliance_score), bindwidth = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(compliance_score), color = "red"), linetype = "dashed", size = 1) + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean (compliance_score) - sd (compliance_score)), color = "pink", linetype = "dashed", size = 1) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(compliance_score) + sd (compliance_score)), color = "pink", linetype = "dashed", size = 1)
  


```

3. Write 2-3 sentences interpreting what the standard deviation and histogram tell us about the distribution of compliance scores. What would be newsworthy about this distribution? What's the story here? (5 points).


The histogram is telling me there are significantly more establishments with a 100% compliance score than other scores. The average is 96%, and the standard deviation, 5.8, is telling me there is a large spread or deviation from the average. Meaning most establishments in Montgomery County are compliant, with some being more or less compliant. 


## Part 2: High School Athletics (25 points)

You are reporting a story about high school sports participation in Maryland and want to see if there are differences between boys and girls. The second dataset shows participation numbers in high school sports across Maryland counties in 2024, broken down by sport and sex. Load the data from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_hs_participation.csv` and complete these tasks:

```{r}
md_hs_participation <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_hs_participation.csv")
```


### Tasks:
1. Calculate the correlation between boys' and girls' participation (5 points)

```{r}

md_hs_participation |>
  summarize( correlation = cor(boys, girls))


```

2. Add two columns called total and girls_pct using mutate(), with the total adding together boys and girls and girls_pct being the percentage of the total represented by girls participants. (5 points)

```{r}

md_hs_participation <- md_hs_participation|>
  mutate(
    total = boys + girls, girls_pct = (boys - total)/total * 100
  )


```

3. Create a scatterplot showing this relationship, adding a line of best fit (5 points)

```{r}

md_hs_participation|>
 ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(x = girls, y = boys)) +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = girls, y = boys), method="lm") +
  geom_text(aes(x = girls, y = boys, label = district))


```

4. In 2-3 sentences, explain what the correlation coefficient and scatterplot reveal about equity in Maryland high school sports participation. How do you interpret the school districts that are below the line vs those that are above? Which school districts are most worth examining further, and why? (10 points)

The scatterplot and correlation coefficient, 0.9, tell me there is a high correlation or close participation between boys and girls in Maryland HS sports. There are some schools that have more girls than boys in their sports team, for example Baltimore County Public Schools have 1858 girls and 739 boys. It would be interesting to examine and find their marketing strategies or demograhic of boys and girls in their school systems to explain the participation in their sports. 


## Part 3: Public Transit Ridership (20 points)

You are investigating public transit ridership in the Washington, D.C. area and want to understand the patterns of daily bus and rail ridership. The third dataset contains daily bus and rail ridership totals from WMATA for the past year. Load the data from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/wmata_daily.csv and do the following:

```{r}

wmata_daily <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/wmata_daily.csv")

```


### Tasks:
1. Calculate the average bus and rail ridership and standard deviation using summarize() (5 points)

```{r}

wmata_daily |>
  summarize (bus_mean = mean(bus), rail_mean = mean(rail), sd_bus = sd(bus), sd_rail = sd(rail))

```

2. Using the process you used in class, take a random sample daily ridership numbers and calculate the sample means and deviations for bus and rail. The number in the sample is up to you, but explain why you chose what you did. Compare this to the stats you generated in step 1. (5 points)

```{r}




```

3. Using group_by() and summarize(), calculate the means for bus and rail ridership for each weekday. Describe the overall pattern of ridership for bus and rail - which days stand out and why? Are there differences between bus and rail in the standard deviation values? (10 points)


```{r}



```



## Part 4: Maryland Car Theft Rates (20 points)

Your editor has assigned you a story about car thefts in Maryland and wants you to analyze the data to find out which counties have the highest rates. The fourth dataset contains car theft statistics for Maryland counties in 2023 and population. Load the data from: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_car_thefts.csv` and complete the following tasks:

```{r}
md_car_thefts <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dwillis/jour405/refs/heads/main/data/md_car_thefts.csv") 

```


### Tasks:
1. Using mutate, add a column that calculates the rate of car thefts for each county - you need to choose the per capita rate (5 points)

```{r}

md_car_thefts <- md_car_thefts |>
  mutate(
    county_theft_rate_2023 = 2023/population * 10000
  )

```

2. Calculate the median car theft rate and the total number of car thefts statewide. Which counties have rates above the median, and what percentage of all car thefts occur in those counties? (5 points)

```{r}

  median( md_car_thefts$'2023')

md_car_thefts|>
  

```

3. Write 2-3 sentences describing what these calculations reveal about the distribution of car thefts in Maryland. What's the lede of a story about your findings? (10 points)


```{r}

```

## Part 5: Data Analysis Scenario (20 points)

You receive a tip that local emergency response times have gotten significantly worse over the past year. You obtain monthly data on response times for police, fire and ambulance calls.

Write 3-4 sentences (no code!) explaining:
1. What statistical measures would you calculate to verify this claim? (10 points)
2. What visualizations would help readers understand the trends? (5 points)
3. What additional context or data would you need to make this a complete story? (5 points)
