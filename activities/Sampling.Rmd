title: "Sampling"
---

Follow along with the demo to learn how to sample data from a population using R and the Tidyverse. You should get started by loading the tidyverse in a new R block.

### Task 1: Load the tidyverse

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```



### Task 2: Load 1,000 rows of data with the ages of people from 18-80
```{r}

set.seed(42) #setting seed for reproducibility
population <- tibble(
  age = sample (18:80, 1000, replace = TRUE)
)


#View the first few rows
head(population)


```


### Task 3: Sample 100 rows of data from the dataset

```{r}

sample_100 <- population |>
  sample_n(100)


sample_50 <- population |>
  sample_n(50)


sample_10 <-population |>
  sample_n

```

### Task 4: Calculate the mean age and standard deviation of the sample


```{r}

sample_100 |> summarize(mean = mean (age), sd = sd(age))

sample_50 |> summarize(mean = mean (age), sd = sd(age))

sample_10 |> summarize(mean = mean (age), sd = sd(age))


```



### Task 5: Calculate the mean age and standard deviation of the population

```{r}

population |> summarize (mean = mean(age), sd = sd(age))


```


### Task 6: Compare the sample and population statistics

Compare the means and standard deviations. Are they similar? Go back and re-run the sampling and statistics calculations with a smaller sample size. How do the results change?

The smaller the sample size the more different answers the class got (sample size 10). The bigger the sample size, the closer or exact our answers were. When we did sample size 50, my mean went down but when I ran sample size 10 my mean went up and my sd went down. This teaches me that conducting a well sized and diverse sample is better to get an average result that you can use to reflect a group or whatever we are trying to represent.
